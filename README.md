Aygaz Image Proccessing Bootcamp
Project Objective 🔭 The objective of this project is to explore how image manipulation techniques, particularly brightness and contrast adjustments, impact the performance of a neural network model in image classification tasks. The project focuses on the following key goals:

Data Augmentation 🌟: Implement and apply various image manipulation techniques, including brightness and contrast adjustments, to enhance the dataset. This helps simulate different lighting conditions that a model may encounter in real-world scenarios.

Model Training and Evaluation 🧠: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of images and evaluate its performance on both normal and manipulated test sets. The model will be trained on standard image data and then tested on images with altered lighting conditions to measure its robustness.

Comparison of Performance Across Test Sets 📊: Assess and compare the model's accuracy across three distinct test sets:

Normal Test Set 📸: The original unaltered images. Manipulated Test Set 🌅: Images with adjusted brightness and contrast to simulate real-world variability in lighting conditions. White-Balanced Test Set 🎨: Images that have undergone white-balancing adjustments to correct for lighting discrepancies. Performance Analysis and Insights 🔍: Analyze and interpret the results obtained from the different test sets. The goal is to understand how well the model generalizes to unseen lighting conditions and to identify areas for improvement, such as enhancing model robustness through further data augmentation or model optimization techniques.

This project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of image preprocessing and data augmentation in building more reliable and adaptable image classification models, especially for use cases involving varying real-world conditions.
Analysis and Insights 🔍:
Upon analyzing the results, it's evident that there is a significant drop in accuracy when testing on the manipulated and white-balanced test sets compared to the normal test set. Below are some potential reasons for this performance gap and steps that could be taken to improve it.

Generalization Issues in the Model 🧠: The drastic decrease in performance on the manipulated and white-balanced test sets indicates that the model struggles to generalize well under different lighting and contrast conditions. This suggests that the model may have overfitted to the specific conditions present in the training data and isn't robust to variations.

Shift in Data Distribution 📊: The manipulated images likely introduced a shift in data distribution that the model wasn't trained on. As a result, the model's ability to recognize patterns in these altered images decreased significantly, showing its sensitivity to changes in the visual properties of the input.

Potential Solutions 🛠️:
Data Augmentation 🌈:

To make the model more robust, I could incorporate more aggressive data augmentation techniques during training, including random brightness, contrast adjustments, and even white-balancing operations. This would help the model learn to adapt to various lighting conditions and increase its generalization capability.
Fine-Tuning the Model 🔧:

Another approach could be to fine-tune the model on a set of manipulated images with different lighting conditions. By retraining or fine-tuning with these variations, the model could better understand the potential changes in image properties.
Regularization Techniques 🧘‍♂️:

Adding more regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization could help the model avoid overfitting to the specific features of the training data and improve its performance on unseen data, including manipulated test sets.
Using Pretrained Models 🤖:

Another solution could be to leverage a pretrained model (such as one based on ImageNet) and fine-tune it on my dataset. Pretrained models often have better generalization capabilities due to their exposure to diverse data during initial training.
Adjusting the Learning Rate ⚙️:

I could experiment with different learning rates or use learning rate schedules to ensure that the model converges better and isn't too sensitive to overfitting.
Conclusion 📈:
The results show that the model performs well on the normal test set, but struggles significantly on manipulated and white-balanced sets. Incorporating more diverse data, applying robust augmentation, and tuning the model further should improve its performance across varying conditions, helping the model become more adaptable to real-world variations.
