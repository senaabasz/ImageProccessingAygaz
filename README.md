Project Objective 🔭 The objective of this project is to explore how image manipulation techniques, particularly brightness and contrast adjustments, impact the performance of a neural network model in image classification tasks. The project focuses on the following key goals:

Data Augmentation 🌟: Implement and apply various image manipulation techniques, including brightness and contrast adjustments, to enhance the dataset. This helps simulate different lighting conditions that a model may encounter in real-world scenarios.

Model Training and Evaluation 🧠: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of images and evaluate its performance on both normal and manipulated test sets. The model will be trained on standard image data and then tested on images with altered lighting conditions to measure its robustness.

Comparison of Performance Across Test Sets 📊: Assess and compare the model's accuracy across three distinct test sets:

Normal Test Set 📸: The original unaltered images. Manipulated Test Set 🌅: Images with adjusted brightness and contrast to simulate real-world variability in lighting conditions. White-Balanced Test Set 🎨: Images that have undergone white-balancing adjustments to correct for lighting discrepancies. Performance Analysis and Insights 🔍: Analyze and interpret the results obtained from the different test sets. The goal is to understand how well the model generalizes to unseen lighting conditions and to identify areas for improvement, such as enhancing model robustness through further data augmentation or model optimization techniques.

This project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of image preprocessing and data augmentation in building more reliable and adaptable image classification models, especially for use cases involving varying real-world conditions.
